## Problem statement associated with virtual hackathon by Ajira
Ajira has developed a rover for extra-terrestrial exploration.
It can be configured to act differently in different environments.
Before sending it on a voyage, we need to simulate an extra-terrestrial environment and test the rover The rover consists of the following internal modules:
Rover Modules
Inventory
This is a storage unit which lets Ajirayaan store important samples and items it has retrieved during exploration.
For example,
Water Samples - 2 units - Priority 2
Rock Samples - 3 units - Priority 3
Storm Shield - 2 units - Priority 1
The inventory has a finite space.
We can add and remove items from the inventory. If the inventory is full and we need to add an item, we must remove items of a lower priority as required.
Battery
The rover has limited battery charge and initially has a battery level of 11.
For every step the rover takes, the battery level decreases by 1.
Every 10 steps, the roverâ€™s battery recharges to a level of 10 (it uses kinetic energy or movement to recharge itself).
If the battery level reaches 0, the rover dies.
Extra-terrestrial Environment
The rover has been designed to be configurable to adapt to any kind of environment.
For the purposes of the simulation, we can consider the following environmental factors:
Temperature
Humidity
Solar Flare. A solar flare recharges the rover's battery fully
Storm. If a storm occurs and the rover isn't shielded, it will be destroyed
Terrain. There are different kinds of terrain such as: "dirt", "water", "rock", "sand"
Simulation
Initial configuration of the environment is as follows:
POST /api/environment/configure
Content-Type: application/json
{
"temperature": 60,
"humidity": 65,
"solar-flare": false,
"storm": false,
"area-map": [
[ "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "water", "dirt" ],
[ "dirt", "dirt", "water", "water", "water" ],
[ "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "water", "dirt" ],
[ "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt" ],
[ "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt", "dirt" ]
]
}
Subsequent modifications to the environment should only be allowed through:
PATCH /api/environment
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
{
"temperature": 20
}

Initial configuration of the rover is done as follows:
